QUESTIONS
    How does the *amount* traded vary over time?
    (** in progress)
	Is non-zero Russell coefficient explained by non-supportable people?
		gini and Russell coefficeint drop drastically when salary is
		increased, but not to zero.
    (** Double-check: if you seriously REMOVE any possibility of a 
        non-supportable person, does this in fact confirm the above)

WE KNOW
	Tipping point at about 80 introversion level
        This tipping point seems robust to changes in salary
            (Introversion65Salary, Introversion35Salary)
        This tipping point seems robust to changes in community size
            Though at extreme introversion levels, a bit more low satisf.
            (Introversion35Salary, IntroversionImage20)

    Tipping point at about 90/year trading rate
        ** Double-check that this moves like we think it will

	Above a certain salary, salary is not very important to satisfaction
    Number of successful trades reaches a wobbly equilibrium over time.
	
UNKNOWNS
    Why the Russell coefficient wobbles over time. (not important)
