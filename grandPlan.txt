    As of 7/3/13, when we segued from "market stuff" to "children stuff," here
was the state of affairs:

WE KNOW
	Tipping point at about 80 introversion level
        This tipping point seems robust to changes in salary
            (Introversion65Salary, Introversion35Salary)
        This tipping point seems robust to changes in community size
            Though at extreme introversion levels, a bit more low satisf.
            (Introversion35Salary, IntroversionImage20)

    Tipping point at about 90/year trading rate
        ** Double-check that this moves like we think it will

	Above a certain salary, salary is not very important to satisfaction
    Number of successful trades reaches a wobbly equilibrium over time.
    Total traded volume reaches a wobbly equilibrium over time.

    * There are a significant number of "unsatisfied people" (meaning, # of
        satisfied goods is < 8) even if:
        - we only look at people in the bottom half of total neediness
        - we eliminate all non-supportable people
        - we jack up the # of agents to 500 and the # of trades initiated
            per person to a constant 500
        - we're trading for 100 years (but which we know is not significant
            anyway)
	
UNKNOWNS
    *Why* do we continue to have non-satisfied people, even considering all
        the attempts to create a satisfiable environment??
    Why the Russell coefficient wobbles over time. (not important)
