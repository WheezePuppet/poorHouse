How much money did they buy it for?
How much did they budget for that good?

What EXACTLY is going on right now?

Steps:
Switch rate is at 5%
Prices start between 1 and 5

All goods are consumed (including produced commodity)
Trading partners is cleared between checks for good
Buying order is not shuffled

Price changes:
Buyers do NOT increase their expected prices in the event of scarcity
    (had been outside parentheses)
Sellers decrease their price by a 1.01 when they have surplus inventory
Sellers raise their price by 1.01 when they sell out
Buyers move towards the price of average sellers polled by 1 tenth

=================
When does that stupid spike occur?
    When I've increased the money supply relative to the production level
    When the initial price level is too low
    when the change rate is low
    Changing any of these things fixes the "problem"
Note that one good drops as the others spike
    What is happening with that good?
    Price dropping means that its utility per unit is rising
    I can see that the droppy one spiked first
    Everyone rushes to spend money on that one and not on the others, they fall back to normal range
How did they rise in the first place, but only when things started far away?
Implementing one of the fixes for the rise causes the average price of the switching goods to be higher
Beware of tipping point somewhere that causes spike

What have I learned?
    One good starts out high, then falls after a point
    It starts going back up before the others start falling
    It has a lower standard deviation and a higher price for awhile
        It is natural to have a lower SD and a lower price
    
A shifts at 255
B shifts at 253
C shifts at earlier
D shifts at 256
E shifts at 253
F shifts at 252
G shifts at
