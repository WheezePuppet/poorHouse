GOAL: Make all beneficial transactions between two people

    Terms:
        great-X->Y commodity: one for which X is below want and Y is
            above need.
        good-X->Y commodity: one for which either (a) X is below want and Y
            is middle ground, or (b) X is middle ground and Y is above need.
    
    Big picture:
    1. See if there are any "super-satisfiable" trades, and resolve them.
        ("super-satisfiable": one where there's a great X->Y commodity and a
            great Y->X commodity.)

    2. See if there any "half-super-satisfiable" trades, and resolve them.
        ("half-super-sat": one where there's a great X->Y commodity and a 
            good Y->X commodity.

    3. See if there are any "ordinary-satisfiable" trades, and resolve them.
        ("ordinary-sat": one where there's a good X->Y commodity and a good
            Y->X commodity.



	See if there is something that one needs that two has a surplus of
	If so,
        See if there is something that two wants that one has
        If so, trade 1:1
    Check again till you can't trade anymore

	Look at the first's goods till you find one that is deficient
	Look to see if the second has a surplus of that good
	If not, find the next deficient good
	If so, proceed to next step
	Look at the first's good till you find one that he has a surplus of
	Look to see if the second has a deficit of that good
	If not, move on to the next surplus good
	If so, enact a 1:1 transaction
		Trade greatest such that neither goes above max or below min
	If you reach the end, the first can't pay, so go to the next agent
