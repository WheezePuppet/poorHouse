V1:
Fixed number of commodities, each with its own fixed consumption rate (not
    dependent on consumer)
One commodity called money
Every person produces some amount of one commodity per time period
Every person starts with a random amount needed for each commodity
Every person starts with a random expected price for each commodity
Every person encounters some number of people per time period
On each encounter:
    for each commodity:
        if both lack, revise price upwards 
        if both have enough, revise price downwards
        if one lacks and other has, trade at average price and revise price
            to average 
Money can go negative

Q's:
Do prices level out according to scarcity?
How long it takes prices to reach equilibrium if they do?
look at variance of expected price in addition to mean


V2:
    strategies for restoring equilibrium:
        - new agents (kids) decide on businesses
        - existing agents can change their business
        - existing agents have a dynamic choice of what to produce



V3+:
communities
can't buy when you're broke
